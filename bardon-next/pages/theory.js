        <h1>Foundational Theories of Franz Bardon's Teachings</h1>

        <div className={styles.theorySection}>
          <h2>The Three Planes of Existence</h2>
          <p>According to Bardon, the universe is divided into three primary planes: the physical, astral, and mental. Each plane has its own laws and characteristics, and mastering each is a step towards hermetic mastery.</p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.theorySection}>
          <h2>The Universal Fluid</h2>
          <p>This theory posits the existence of a universal fluid or energy that permeates everything. This fluid can be polarized into electric (positive) and magnetic (negative) fluids, representing active and passive forces, respectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.theorySection}>
          <h2>The Concept of Akasha</h2>
          <p>Akasha, often referred to as the ether, is considered the fifth element or quintessence. It serves as the medium of all causes and effects, storing universal memories and knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.theorySection}>
          <h2>Magical Equilibrium</h2>
          <p>One of the cornerstones of Bardon's teachings, Magical Equilibrium is about balancing the four elements within oneself, leading to inner harmony and mastery over one's environment.</p>
