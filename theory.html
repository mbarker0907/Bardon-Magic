        <h1>Theory of Initiation into Hermetics</h1>
        <p>Initiation into Hermetics provides step-by-step instruction in the form of practical exercises. These exercises lead to the development of body, soul, and spirit. The result is a new astral and physical body, and therefore the Spirit obtains the 'resurrection body'.</p>

        <h2>The Three Planes</h2>
        <p>According to Bardon, the universe is composed of three primary planes: the physical, the astral, and the mental. Each of these planes has its own laws and its own beings.</p>

        <h2>Steps of the Initiation</h2>
        <p>Bardon's work presents a series of exercises in ten steps, each with its own goal, and increasing in complexity. They revolve around visualization, meditation, and direct action upon the astral and mental bodies.</p>
